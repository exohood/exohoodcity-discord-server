 * Managers that allow to modify (PATCH) existing entities
 * with either an update task or atomic setters. This also includes classes which allow to
 * operate on entities like the moderation of a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Guild Guild}.
 *
 * <p>Manager types allow to directly modify one or more values.
 *
 * <p>Almost all managers require a RestAction execution.
